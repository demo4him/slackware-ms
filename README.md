You can install Slackware with a minimum of packages but it is functional for network (includes NetworkManager + applet) and desktop environment installation.
You can choose the file (lftp downloads + installpkg */*.t?z) for DE.
The file must be executable. For example, run chmod u+x Install-MATE.
Add download latest version of Firefox Browser script.
For Nvidia Video Card download Nvidia-Driver script. You can modify script to chose preferred version of proprietary driver.



To be appreciated: Repositories are from https://slackware.uk, except ponce’s one (http://ponce.cc/slackware/slackware64-15.0/lxde/). DEs scripts are also based on lftp command and pkgtool. All credits to them and slackware’s and linux world! Thanks for sharing!
